# Abridge
I've checked your app for an hour and here is my notes:
## Questions
1) How do you work with your trained model on iOS? Is it CoreML or is it a server?

CoreML -> WWDC 2019 mentions that Core ML 3 has some ability to do on device training have you checked that? (https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/704/)

Server -> How do you queue them? FIFO?

2) Keychain
a) My sign in and all my records was there even after I re-installed the app. Are you using Keychain? 
b) Are records being stored in the Keychain as well?
c) How large is your data there? Because I know NSUserDefaults may cause hanging in the app and has a notification property for observing if it has exceeded its limit. Is there any problem with your app related to using Keychain?

3) Recording Details -> nice animation for gathering insights. Are you using Lottie or a video?

## Feedbacks about the App
1) Onboarding
a) You can use SafariVC for opening terms and policies instead of opening Safari app itself.
b) You will need "Sign in with Apple" due to third party Google option.

2) Create Account
a) You can make first name and last name text fields predictive of the user by `TextField.textContentType`
b) Tapping on top of the screen does not dismiss keyboard.
c) Entering my last name and then Tapping "Done" on keyboard navigates me to email. However entering my email and then tapping "Done" button on keyboard does not navigate me to the next screen.

3) Sign In
a) Tapping anywhere does not dismiss keyboard.
b) It would be nice to have a larger scrolling with disabled scrolling indicator it feels weird while dismissing keyboard by swiping
c) Activating enter password makes field jump and come back.
d) You can make email text fields predictive by `TextField.textContentType`

4) Forgot password 
a) It remembers entered email which is nice. However it resets after coming back to sign in again.
b) Also has problems with keyboard 

5) Menu
a) Since it's a custom menu I believe VoiceOver does not work properly for neither side bar button nor opened side bar. It only says `Possibly - Menu`, you can add some accessibility hints.

6) Menu -> Support
a) You may also use MessageUI in order to help users to send their emails inside the app.

7) Health Stories -> Record
a) Record screen `Cancel` or close button is not visible when microphone is disabled.
b) Wave animation during recording on bottom seems nice. However it's not compatible with bottom safe area and starts with a gap.

8) Health Stories -> Recordings
a) You can also add an accessibility hint here for VoiceOver since user does not know how to open recording.
b) Opening a recording details using bottom player would be nice with an animation.
c) `Your recording has been deleted` alert is not animating properly. It jumps to its initial position twice during the transition.

9) Recording Details
a) Three dots button, info button, and bottom section do not have any accessibility labels
b) Very minor: Three dots button is shifting towards left after unhiglighting it.
c) Editing: Text fields are going off of the screen. Keyboard `Next` or `Done` buttons may activate the next fields.
d) Editing: I really liked tagging and its flashing animation for already existing one. However Tags are causing scrolling issues when that area is also scrollable.
e) Estimated time always shows up just before the process is done for like 1-2 seconds.

## Ideas
Are you thinking about using Apple Watch maybe as a remote control for starting & pausing recording and also displaying its duration?
